<h1>AlgoSim: A extensible Algorithm Simulator</h1>
<p>
<h3 align="center">1.0 </h3><h2><a class="anchor" name="Introduction">
Introduction</a></h2>
AlgoSim is highly extensible software which helps build variety of educational, demonstrative applications with ease and flexibility. It very flexible because it's rules or standards are suggestive and are not enforced. <h2><a class="anchor" name="Features">
Features</a></h2>
It's important feature is the ability to load dynamically algorithms after compiling them into a shared object. The user algos are stored seperately and are compiled when the applications starts up. Then the user is given choice to load the algos which were succesfully compiled. This plugin model enables the extensibility of the application.<p>
The library provides tools and utilities to build new algos very easily. You just need to inherit from libraries interface classes and implement few funtions. And put your cpp files into the algos folder like algos/myNewAlgo/*.cpp and when you run the main application next time your algo will be listed in the main menu if your cpp files were succesfully compiled.<p>
The AlgoSim ships in with two such algorithms.<br>
 1. Booth's Algorithm <br>
 2. Robertson's Algorithm <br>
 both for multiplication <br><br>


Note:<br>1. To run the application, first set "Allow execution" option under "Permissions" tab in Properties page of 'algosim' by right-clicking 'algosim'. Then double-click the 'algosim' icon.<br>
	2. It requires g++ package installed.<br>
<br><br>

AlgoSim<br>
---------------------------------------<br>

Contents of the package:<br>
1. algos : This folder contains the algorithms, the source code and any images, particular to the algorithm to be simulated. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a. common : This folder contains the common files required to compile the algorithms, like headers.<br>
2. doc : The complete documentation generated out of source code using Doxygen. To begin reading documentation, start with index.html file in the doc folder.<br>
3. lib : This folder contains the compiled form of external libraries used in the project.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;1. libmgrxX.a : The MGRX graphics library. Compiled to archive, has no other dependencies.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2. libptypes.a: The Portable Types library. Used for multithreading. All animations and message passing is done using this library. This requires 'pthread' library, which is present in all Linux machines.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Subfolder 'src' has the source code of these two libraries.<br>
4. src : This folder contains the entire source code of AlgoSim. The file 'compile' contains the command-line required to compile the code. To compile, 'libjpeg', 'libpthread' and 'libX11' libraries are required which is present in most Linux systems.<br>
5. algosim : The executable file. Just double-click the 'algosim' to run the application.<br>
6. README : This file.<br>
<br><br>

How it works?<br>
---------------------------------------<br>
	To run the application just double-click the 'algosim'. The external libraries are linked statically, hence it can run on virtually any Linux machines. When AlgoSim is run, it looks for the algos folder and compiles the .cpp files in the folders in algos folder and builds a Shared Object (.so file; Shared Object is the same as Dynamic Link Library or .dll in Windows). Then it attempts to load the Shared Object and reads information about the algorithm. Then it lists the available algorithms and asks user to choose one. Once user chooses an algorithm the control is passed on to the selected algorithm.<br>
	Algosim provides this basic mechanism to dynamically load algorithms. This allows algorithms to be added without recompiling the main application. Thus algorithms are just like plugins plugged into the main application.<br>
	Algosim also provides some functionalities and support systems, to help write new algorithms easily. These includes an Animation library which supports sprite based animations. It also provides asynchronous message passing.<br>
<br><br>

How to write a new Algorithm?<br>
---------------------------------------<br>
	Implementing a new algorithm is very easy. We just need to include the main library header and create some classes which inherits some Base classes and implement some virtual functions to get the skelton up and running. Further algorithm specific logic can be added easily. You may use support libraries and functions provided by the algosim to speed up the development process. Please refer to the two algorithms, Booth and Robertson algorithms, which will guide you through the process of developing a new algorithm<br>
	<br><br>
	
Future?<br>
---------------------------------------<br>
	Many more algorithms can simulated using AlgoSim which has diagrametic representation and can be expressed through simple sprite animation. Also there are some Thread Synchronisation problems in Algosim, which is due to the fact that the graphics library used here was not designed keeping multithreading in mind. So you may observe some issues regarding color mixups.<br>
